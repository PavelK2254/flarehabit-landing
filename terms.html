        <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
        <p>
            By accessing and using FlareHabit ("the App"), you accept and agree to be bound by the terms 
            and provision of this agreement. If you do not agree to these Terms of Service, please do not 
            use the App.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
        <p>
            FlareHabit is a gamified habit tracking application that helps users build and maintain positive 
            habits through features including XP and levels, achievements, streaks, and AI-powered habit 
            suggestions. We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue any aspect of the service 
            at any time.
        </p>

        <h2>3. User Accounts</h2>
        <p>
            To use certain features of the App, you must create an account. You are responsible for:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials</li>
            <li>All activities that occur under your account</li>
            <li>Notifying us immediately of any unauthorized use of your account</li>
            <li>Ensuring that your account information is accurate and up-to-date</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. User Conduct</h2>
        <p>You agree not to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Use the App for any illegal or unauthorized purpose</li>
            <li>Violate any laws in your jurisdiction</li>

            <li>Impersonate any person or entity</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Intellectual Property</h2>
        <p>
            The App and its original content, features, and functionality are owned by FlareHabit and are 
            protected by international copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret, and other intellectual 
            property or proprietary rights laws. You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any 
            part of our services or software.
        </p>

        <h2>6. User Content</h2>
        <p>
            You retain all rights to the habit data and content you create in the App. By using the App, 
            you grant us a license to use, store, and process your content solely for the purpose of 
            providing and improving our services.
        </p>

        <h2>7. AI-Powered Features</h2>
        <p>
            The App uses artificial intelligence to provide personalized habit suggestions. While we strive 
            for accuracy, AI suggestions are not professional advice and should not be treated as such. 
            You are solely responsible for the habits you choose to track and follow.
        </p>

        <h2>8. Subscription and Payments</h2>
        <p>
            Certain features of the App may require a paid subscription. All fees are non-refundable unless 
            required by law. We reserve the right to change our pricing at any time, with notice to existing 
            subscribers.
        </p>

        <h2>9. Termination</h2>
        <p>
            We may terminate or suspend your account and access to the App immediately, without prior notice 
            or liability, for any reason, including but not limited to a breach of these Terms. Upon 
            termination, your right to use the App will immediately cease.
        </p>

        <h2>10. Disclaimers</h2>
        <p>
            The App is provided on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis. We make no warranties, expressed or 
            implied, regarding the App's operation or the information, content, or materials included. We do 
            not warrant that the App will be uninterrupted, secure, or error-free.
        </p>

        <h2>11. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>
            To the fullest extent permitted by law, FlareHabit shall not be liable for any indirect, 
            incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits or revenues, 
            whether incurred directly or indirectly, or any loss of data, use, goodwill, or other intangible 
            losses resulting from your use of the App.
        </p>

        <h2>12. Changes to Terms</h2>
        <p>
            We reserve the right to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a revision is material, 
            we will provide at least 30 days' notice prior to any new terms taking effect. What constitutes 
            a material change will be determined at our sole discretion.
        </p>

        <h2>13. Governing Law</h2>
        <p>
            These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction

        <h2>15. Severability</h2>
        <p>
            If any provision of these Terms is held to be unenforceable or invalid, such provision will be 
            changed and interpreted to accomplish the objectives of such provision to the greatest extent 
            possible under applicable law, and the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect.
